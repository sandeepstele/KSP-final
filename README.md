# Predictive Crime Analytics
Predictive Crime Analytics is a web-based application developed using Django that offers advanced crime analysis and prediction capabilities. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and historical crime data, the platform provides insights into crime hotspots, trends, and patterns. Users can explore crime statistics, conduct behavioral analysis of criminals and victims, and predict future crime occurrences based on past data. The application also offers month-wise crime group analysis, empowering law enforcement agencies and policymakers with valuable information for proactive crime prevention strategies. With its user-friendly interface and powerful analytics features, Predictive Crime Analytics aims to enhance public safety and support decision-making in combating crime.
